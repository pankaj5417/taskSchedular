FrameWork : I have used nodejs as framework and JavaScript as language to solve this problem

Approach: First of all I loop through the eventData and 
  I have taken the task and schedule it through the help of nodejs schedular 
  that takes the task name and time at which the task should run as callback and run that particular event
  at the particular time . I have used setTimeout() function to make the task sleep for the length of that 
  task string (in seconds) and once timer expires it appears after that much time period that is equal to the
  length of the task string.
